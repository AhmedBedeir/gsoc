## Introduction

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Ahmed Bedeir](https://github.com/AhmedBedeir), and I'm a passionate software engineer based in Egypt. I have a deep appreciation for the power of open-source software, and I'm eager to contribute my skills to the open-source community.

As a beginner open-source contributor, I'm thrilled to be given the opportunity to participate in GSoC with Wagtail. The chance to work alongside other talented developers and experienced mentors to build something that will have a positive impact on the world is truly exhilarating.

With my technical skills in Python, Django, and JavaScript, attention to detail, and ability to work in a team, I believe I can make a valuable contribution to the Wagtail project. I'm passionate about learning from experienced mentors, collaborating with other contributors, and making a tangible difference in the open-source community.

Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. I look forward to connecting with you all and expanding my knowledge in open-source communities.
